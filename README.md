### Description:

When I created this project, it started out as an online challenge to create an application that could just simply show text and do nothing else. But I decided that I wanted the user to be able to write documents and save them at any time. I started implementing new features across the application and try to design a project that wold test my knowledge in C# and enhance it at the same time.

LightPad has its own features such as being able to enable a dark mode that stops the eyes from being strained when using the application. It has its own word count feature that allows the user to count how many words the user has typed and display this action at the top of the screen.


### Planned Features:
* Place the word count in a different area (Default is corner)
* Replace some of the icons with higher quality 
* Enable double clicking to turn off features


### What I learnt:

- Better planning using Trello board
- Placing comments in the application
- Using keyboard shotcuts to reduce development time
- Writing cleaner code
- Better understanding of interfaces
- How to use GitHub properly
- How to track GitHub changes
- How to revert back to original changes in GitHub
- Unit Testing to check functions work

### Ad-Hoc Testing
- Title: Ad hoc testing of LightPad
- Tester: Ainsley Crawford
- Technique: Ad-Hoc
- Date: 02/12/19

1. Ctrl+u has two functions:
	Pressing ctrl+u once performs the undo function. However, pressing ctrl+u a second time without perfroming any other actions then toggles on the underline font type.
	Additionally, ctrl+u can toggle the underline font on, but cannot toggle it off (unless the previous action was to underline a selection of text, in which case the underline is removed because the previous action is undone).
	NB: Ctrl+z properly executes the undo function.

2. The app does not allow different font sizes:
	A uniform font size is maintained, even when a portion of text is highlighted in an attempt to diversify the body of text.
	Interestingly, it is possible to have multiple font colours, which indicates this fault is repairable.

3. Non-functional bold tab in tool bar:
	Although the keybard short-cut ctrl+b functions, the tab does not produce any effect.
	
### Constraints:

I had some problems where the application wouldn't save and it would crash the application, however I solved this problem. Also another problem was that the application was taking a lot of RAM up when the user would start clicking on the objects.

### Improvements:

I think the interface could be changed and also if the user clicked on the bold icon and decided to click on it again to turn off the feature, it won't let the user. I think this should be fixed as this is a flaw within the application.

With LightPad the user can also set the application to dark mode to restrain the application from damaging their eyes.

User can also revert back to the white background if they don't like to using the black background.

The user can change the font size, colour and insert the date/time in the document. If the user needs to check how many words they have typed in the document then they can right click and then activate that function.
